## Goal:

- Commiting as someone else via their account information
- Recreating what happened to [jameskit616]("https://github.com/jameskitt616") in this [commit]("https://github.com/jizyy6c1s/scaling-adventure/commits?author=jameskitt616")


## Findings:

- It only takes the E-Mail of a user to imperonate a person. The Username doesn't even need to be changed
- GitHubs Response:
